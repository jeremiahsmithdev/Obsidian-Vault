üìö¬†The modern day reading list includes more than just books. We've created a dashboard to help you track books, articles, podcasts, and videos. Each media type has its own view based on the Type property. 

‚úÇÔ∏è One more thing... if you install the Notion Web Clipper, you can save links off the web directly to this table.

üëá Click through the different database tabs to see other views. Sort content by status, author, type, or publisher.
