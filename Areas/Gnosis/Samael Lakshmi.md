## ETERNAL AND UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE

# What is Gnosis?

The word Gnosis comes from ancient Greek. It forms the root of many words we use daily, such as prognosis, diagnosis.

The term Gnosis represents a knowledge that leads us to spiritual realization and harmonious personal development, as well as a harmonious development with our surroundings.

True Gnosis is universal and allows the consciousness to free itself from limitations and psychological defects.

It is for all human beings, regardless of their culture, race or gender.

It is a practical knowledge that guides us in the search for the meaning and purpose of our existence. It is the very basis of our direct experiences. Thus we all have something of the Gnosis within us, for it is our measure of truth.

## “Tragic is the existence of one who dies without having known the purpose of his existance.”

## — V.M. Samael Aun Weor

## THE ESOTERICISM OF RELIGIONS

# The Origin of Gnosis

Gnosis existed in all the great civilizations.

Gnosis does not belong to any religion, school or group, but to all those who, by means of enormous efforts and sacrifices, reach the summit of Wisdom and Being:

The Lamas of Tibet, the Brahmins of India, the great sages of China, the magi of Babylonia, the Hierophants of Egypt, the Celtic Druids, the philosophers and initiates of the mysteries of Greece, the Maya, Aztec, Inca and Toltec.
