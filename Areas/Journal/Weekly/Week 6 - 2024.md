# Happenings

Brendan is here and we should be getting started with fixing the injectors on my van. Starting by sourcing some injectors and injector seals. I'll have to speak to dad and/or Caleb again about borrowing money for some injectors.

Viv has moved in for a week or two.

# Workout

# Running

Starting the pre-build for Gold Coast Marathon. I'd like to get a baseline mileage to start with so I will run as much as I comfortably feel with consistency and build from there. Minimum 5 days of running for the week.
