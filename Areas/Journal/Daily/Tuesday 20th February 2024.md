# Practice

- **Wake time:** 10:10am
- **Time asleep:** 7h27m
- **Dream:**
    - I was holding a ribbon that was making loops in the sky at a festival. I grabbed the end and flew into the sky as the ribbon caught the wind. When coming back from the car/campsite of the festival I looked back at Kudra’s car where her friends were gathered around her. She was inside as I just caught her tattoos on her leg hanging below the car door. I looked back at my friend as we headed to the dance floor and she gave me a knowing smile. This friend was a very pretty woman with dark brown hair who I seemed to have a platonic relationship with. She gave a comforting motherly energy. Looking back I wonder if she was some apparition of my divine mother. At the time she was simply a close friend with a homely feminine energy. An unknown identity and yet I knew her all too well… Later on I found myself with a bunch of people on a mountain sheltering in a tunnel while we rested on a long journey through the wilderness. I went outside first waiting for the others to start the journey again. Skipping forwards, I found myself retracing my steps to find where we had been doing this trip by walking along a globe of Google Maps until I was standing on the mountain we had traveled over.

## Reflections

After meditating last night I definitely remembered my dreams better. I think starting to cut down on coffee helped too as my brain is repairing. The meditation was easier than expected and felt very good. Often after coming back to meditation for some time it is easy at first as my mind has been craving the release of it. The thoughts happily disperse for some time and process themselves with zero exertion.

My run today felt controlled after going out easy for the first 300m behind Reggie. I think I already feel the fitness difference after running red train on Sunday. There is a mental fortitude that is back and my body is better prepared for the stress of running.

I got the injectors to Toronto Vapour Blasting for ultrasonic cleaning. That should completely rid them of carbon so that Brendan and I can try starting the van when we get them back.

Brendan made some barbed comments about me being argumentative. I did not like that and told him off for being disrespectful to me in my home. I had a chat with Nathaniel on text and he was talking to me about letting people into my castle. Not just psychologically but literally.
