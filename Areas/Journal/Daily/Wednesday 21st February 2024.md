# Yesterday

Yesterday I put in my injectors for ultrasonic cleaning at Toronto Vapour Cleaning and went to interval training. I had an argument with Brendan about some disrespectful comments he made about me. I am feeling very negative towards him at the moment and would probably prefer he leave even if it means I don’t get help from him to fix my van.

Last night I had difficulty getting to sleep due to the mocha I had before intervals. I was tossing and turning for about an hour and went on my phone to look at air bnb options for Gold Coast Marathon.

# Today

I moved the meeting with Wes to 2:30pm so that mum can drop me there.

I managed to get up just after 8:30, do pranayama, no meditation, and a 5km run to start the day. Then showered, had brekky, did some reading of BASB, and now am journaling and starting study for the upcoming meeting.
