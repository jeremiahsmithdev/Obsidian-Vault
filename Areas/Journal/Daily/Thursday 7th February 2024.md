I want to make this a daily habit even if it is just to review my tasks for the day. Writing notes etc can be optional. The thing is I need to make it functional. Something for it all to orbit around. You see, right now I am taking notes only because I want to create a routine around reviewing my tasks. The journalling is a side effect if my decision to take this time to review my day and be organised.

Right now it's 1am and I'm planning my day ahead.

  

Evening:

I didn’t manage to do any notes in the morning. I checked off the task of getting the 5000m ticket. Today was filled with working with Brendan again on The White Pearl, now dubbed “La Perla Blanca”. It fired up with some start ya bastard. But there is still no fuel delivery and it would not stay on whatsoever. We filled the tank with 20 more litres of diesel and confirmed that all 4 injectors are receiving fuel. The main part of the progress was actually getting the solar reconnected as we pulled off the roof deck and connected the two old framed panels. I also reset the Renogy DC charger so that I could connect to the bluetooth and see the input amps. Hopefully tomorrow it will receive more amps to get some decent charge in the batteries.
