# Happenings

After setting my alarm for 8:30 to start waking up earlier, I woke up and lay on my phone for a bit before doing a short pranayama. I had used a gentle bird sound wake up alarm with the “Awakening” app which worked fairly well. I had also typically stayed up too late and am tired this morning but I’ve had two cups of coffee.

Viv left for her physio appointment. Brendan has a doctor’s appointment in Hamilton that he can’t afford.

# Action Items

I replied to Kyra that I was interested in the [Haast.io](http://Haast.io) job. She has asked for an updated resume.

- [x] Send updated resume

# Reflections

I have a lot of egos coming out today due to my recent indulgences. I felt offended by Viv leaving and I was also offended by Nathaniel and Mum in the lounge room. My lust comes out in aggressive ways.

I hurt my nerves from thinking that I lost Brendan’s keys and looking around for them for half an hour with KART. Thanks to Jenny for helping me to find them.
