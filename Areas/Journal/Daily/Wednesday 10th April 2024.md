I finished One Tree Hill, at least up until season 6 where Lucas and Peyton leave. Feeling fairly sentimental about it. Can't really watch it without their characters.
There were some takeaways. Something about remembering to love.

"_To all those lost souls who have forgotten to believe in the immensity of love._"

And about living.
It made me want to write my heart out. To sing. A poem, a song, anything. To express myself.

## Today
What did I do?
Woke up at midday. Did pranayama, made breakfast and chai.
Did a threshold interval run.
