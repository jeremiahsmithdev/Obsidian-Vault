## Reflections

I made a deal with Nathaniel the other day that we would start getting off coffee. This week we agreed on one coffee per day. Then following weeks we are sticking to coffee only on weekends. Today was the first day with only one coffee. I felt it in the afternoon when I had to have a nap on the couch. During that nap it felt like my brain was repairing itself somewhat. Resetting itself to a more relaxed state.

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow Brendan and I will look into cracking the injectors open and cleaning them ourselves. I also have to do some research on OAuth. And I have intervals in the arvo at 5.
