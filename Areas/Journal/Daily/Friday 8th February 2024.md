Prenight comments: Will be working with Brendan again on the van.

  

5000m champs is now 2 days from now.

  

I woke up late again. Almost 10. First time I woke up was around 8:30. Then around 9:30 and I sat in bed on my phone until Brendan called me.

  

Dad was here when I woke up. Brendan was hanging out with him and talking while he worked on the Land Rover. Brendan and I went to Autumn Rooms and got coffee and brekky. The guy called saying they now have the ignition switch.
