TLDR:

Bleeding by cranking not recommended

Get a fuel primer

  

- Jack up the back

  

Hello and welcome to Just Answer  
OK on a TDCI ( your engine) don't crack any pipes off as this will introduce air  
what usually helps is to use a vacuum pump or a hand primer like this:

to draw the fuel through from the tank  
It also helps to try jacking the back of the van up so any air in the line will tend to travel back to the tank
