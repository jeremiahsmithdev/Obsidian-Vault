Q: I want some ideas for fixing my 2005 MK6 2.4L turbo diesel Ford Transit T350 van. It has 450,000km. It has recently had the timing chain replaced. Since the timing chain was replaced the mechanics showed me that the engine turning on and running but it was losing power and would then turn off. Since retrieving my van from the mechanic I have not been able to start it. I am concerned that they disconnected something before giving it back to me because they were half way through looking at it and now it turns over but does not start again. This is the same as it was doing when I sent it to the mechanic in the first place. Now I am looking at the van with my mechanic friend and he is diagnosing the issue. We have started by charging up the battery and ruling out various issues by inspecting the van parts and seeing that most things are in good condition. Considering the above, what is a likely issue causing the van from not starting after the recent timing chain replacement?

  

Answer:

Given the recent timing chain replacement and the subsequent issue of the van losing power and not starting, there are several potential issues that could be causing the problem:

1. **Timing Misalignment**: Although the timing chain was replaced, there could be an issue with the timing being misaligned. If the timing is off, it can cause the engine to lose power and not start properly. Your mechanic friend should check the timing marks to ensure they are aligned correctly.
2. **Fuel System Problems**: The issue could also be related to the fuel system. If there are problems with fuel delivery, such as a clogged fuel filter, faulty fuel injectors, or air in the fuel lines, it could prevent the engine from starting or cause it to lose power. Your mechanic friend should check the fuel pressure and inspect the fuel system components for any issues.
3. **Electrical Issues**: There could be electrical issues affecting the ignition system or other components necessary for the engine to start. This could include faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or sensors. Your mechanic friend should check for any error codes using a diagnostic scanner and inspect the electrical components for any signs of damage or malfunction.
4. **Compression Problems**: If there are issues with engine compression, such as worn piston rings or damaged valves, it could cause the engine to lose power and have difficulty starting. A compression test can help determine if there are any issues with engine compression.
5. **Faulty Parts**: It's possible that a faulty or incorrectly installed part is causing the issue. Your mechanic friend should double-check all the parts that were replaced during the timing chain replacement to ensure they are installed correctly and functioning properly.
6. **Software/ECU Issues**: Sometimes, after a major repair like a timing chain replacement, the engine control unit (ECU) may need to be reset or reprogrammed to adapt to the new components. Your mechanic friend should check if there are any software updates available for the ECU and perform any necessary reprogramming.

These are just some possible causes of the issue based on the information provided. Your mechanic friend will need to thoroughly diagnose the van to determine the exact cause of the problem.
