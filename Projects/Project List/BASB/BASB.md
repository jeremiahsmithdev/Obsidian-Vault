A second brain is a system that helps you remember things and organize your digital life. This includes tools for note-taking, managing tasks, organizing tabs, saving articles to read later, scheduling events, and more. The goal is to externalize your memory, so you can focus on thinking and creating, rather than remembering.

# My Approach

A blend between Notion and pen to paper journaling.

I use Notion to store complex ideas. Where I need to type as fast as I think and I want to be able to store and retrieve my ideas for later. When I want to use templates, and categorize notes by projects, timelines, labels etc.

I use my personal journal to jot down my daily list of habits, musings, focus and todo items, as a visual reminder of what I have achieved throughout the day and what I am doing. Itâ€™s more of a meditative and clearing the mind process away from technology. A non-committal, brooding process of note taking with presence in mind.
